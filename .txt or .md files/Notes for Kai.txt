NEW assignment - start building the engine as well as a simple GUI to test all the engine functions. At minimum, it should have:
A button to create a 52-card deck.
A button to create zones
A button to move cards between zones. 

Start with the building blocks of the engine, just what you need to get the above working. You don't need to create the whole thing yet.

NEXT assignment: Once you've got the engine and a GUI working, we'll start with very simple scripts (simpler even than War) that call the engine functions.

Moving forward, get in the habit of structuring your web projects like this:
root directory:
	-"css" directory (put your css files here)
	-"src" directory (all your .js files go here)
		- "server" directory (.js files on the server go here)
		- "public" directory (.js files for the client go here)
	-"imgs" directory (images go here, if any)
	"index.html"

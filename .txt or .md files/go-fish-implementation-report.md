# Go Fish Implementation Report
## Functions and Classes Used from Card Game Engine

### Overview
This report documents the implementation of Go Fish using the card-game-engine.html framework, showing exactly which classes and functions were utilized throughout the process.

## Classes Used

### 1. **GameEngine Class** 
**Primary controller for the entire game**

**Functions Called:**
- `startNewGame()` - Initialized a fresh game state
- `createPlayer(name)` - Created 4 players for Go Fish (called 4 times)
- `createBoard(width, height)` - Set up 14x12 game board
- `createZone(name, playerId, x, y, width, height, options)` - Created 10 zones total:
  - 1 deck zone (center)
  - 4 hand zones (one per player)
  - 4 books zones (for collected sets)
- `moveCard(fromZone, toZone, playerId)` - Used for dealing cards and drawing
- `getCardCount(zoneName, playerId)` - Checked deck and hand counts
- `log(message)` - Logged game events and player actions
- `getPlayer(playerId)` - Retrieved player objects
- `updateDisplay()` - Refreshed visual display
- `startTurn()` - Initiated player turns
- `endGame()` - Ended game when win condition met
- `checkWinCondition()` - Overridden for Go Fish rules

### 2. **Player Class**
**Managed individual player data and zones**

**Functions Called:**
- `getId()` - Retrieved player ID
- `getName()` - Got player display name
- `getScore()` - Retrieved current book count
- `adjustScore(amount)` - Added books to score (+1 per book)
- `getZone(zoneName)` - Accessed player's hand and books zones
- `addZone(zone)` - Associated zones with players

### 3. **Zone Class**
**Managed card areas (hands, books, deck)**

**Functions Called:**
- `addCard(card)` - Added cards to zones
- `removeCard(cardId)` - Removed specific cards by ID
- `removeTopCard()` - Drew cards from deck/hands
- `getTopCard()` - Accessed most recent card
- `getCardCount()` - Counted cards in zone
- `getCards()` - Retrieved all cards in zone for analysis
- `updateDisplay()` - Refreshed visual representation

### 4. **Card Class**
**Individual card representation and behavior**

**Functions Called:**
- `getId()` - Unique card identification
- `getRank()` - Got card rank (A, 2, 3... K) for matching
- `setFaceUp(boolean)` - Controlled card visibility
- `getDisplayText()` - Generated visual card representation

### 5. **Deck Class**
**Standard 52-card deck management**

**Functions Called:**
- `constructor()` - Created standard 52-card deck
- `shuffle()` - Randomized card order
- `getCards()` - Retrieved all deck cards for zone placement

### 6. **GameBoard Class**
**Spatial organization of game zones**

**Functions Called:**
- `addZone(zone)` - Added zones to board
- `getZone(name, playerId)` - Found specific zones by name/owner

## Custom Go Fish Functions Created

### Game Setup Functions
- `loadGoFishGame()` - Complete game initialization
- `checkForBooks()` - Automated book collection logic
- `checkGoFishWinCondition()` - Win condition checking
- `askForCards(askingPlayer, targetPlayer, rank)` - Core game mechanic

### Game Flow Summary

1. **Initialization Phase:**
   ```javascript
   gameEngine.startNewGame()
   gameEngine.createPlayer() × 4
   gameEngine.createBoard(14, 12)
   gameEngine.createZone() × 10 zones
   ```

2. **Setup Phase:**
   ```javascript
   new Deck()
   deck.shuffle()
   deck.getCards().forEach() → zone.addCard()
   gameEngine.moveCard() × 28 times (7 cards per player)
   ```

3. **Game Play Phase:**
   ```javascript
   player.getZone('hand').getCards()
   card.getRank() for matching
   zone.removeCard() / zone.addCard() for transfers
   player.adjustScore() for book collection
   ```

4. **Win Detection:**
   ```javascript
   players.forEach(player => player.getScore())
   gameEngine.endGame()
   ```

## Key Implementation Insights

### Engine Strengths Utilized:
1. **Modular Zone System** - Easily created distinct areas for hands, books, and deck
2. **Automatic Visual Updates** - Zones updated display when cards moved
3. **Player Management** - Built-in scoring and turn management
4. **Card State Management** - Face up/down handling for player hands
5. **Logging System** - Built-in event tracking for game flow

### Custom Logic Required:
1. **Book Detection Algorithm** - Grouped cards by rank and detected sets of 4
2. **Card Request Validation** - Ensured players own cards they're asking for
3. **Turn Continuation Logic** - Successful asks continue turn, "Go Fish" ends turn
4. **Multi-Zone Card Transfer** - Moving cards between different players' zones

## Function Call Frequency Analysis

**Most Used Functions:**
- `zone.getCards()` - Called every book check (frequent)
- `card.getRank()` - Called for every card in rank matching
- `gameEngine.log()` - Called for every game event
- `zone.addCard()` / `zone.removeCard()` - Called for every card movement

**Critical Functions:**
- `gameEngine.createZone()` - Essential for game setup
- `player.adjustScore()` - Core scoring mechanism
- `gameEngine.moveCard()` - Primary card movement function

---

## Conclusion

The card game engine successfully provided all necessary building blocks for Go Fish implementation. The modular design allowed for easy creation of complex game mechanics while the built-in visual system handled display updates automatically. The engine's flexibility enabled both simple setup functions and complex game logic like book detection and turn management.

**Total Classes Used: 6**
**Total Functions Called: 25+ unique functions**
**Custom Functions Added: 4 Go Fish-specific functions**

Moving forward, get in the habit of structuring your web projects like this:

root directory:
	-"css" directory (put your css files here)
	-"src" directory (all your .js files go here)
		- "server" directory (.js files on the server go here)
		- "public" directory (.js files for the client go here)
	-"imgs" directory (images go here, if any)
	"index.html"
